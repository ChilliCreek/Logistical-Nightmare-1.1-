# Logistical-Nightmare-1.1-
Newer version that is supposed to have logistics mechanics. The idea to make this game was inspired an old card game, 
The Campaign for North Africa by Simulation Publications. I had a pretty basic 1.0 demo. I was thinking of doing this just in C++, but I might use C++ instead.
The current goal is to have a aplyable demo with the core mecahnics by the end of the summer.
