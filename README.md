# Logistical-Nightmare-1.1-
This is the newer version of Logistical Nightmare 1.0 that is supposed to have logistics mechanics. The idea to make this game was inspired an old card game, 
The Campaign for North Africa by Simulation Publications. I have a pretty basic 1.0 demo in anotehr repository named Logistical Nightmare 1.0. I had to do many revisions over the course of an year, and redo many rookie mistakes I did when I was a freshman.
